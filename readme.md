# A Practical Approach to Getting Started

## Key Starting Questions


    - What is the starting state?
    - How do I display the state of the game to the user?
    - What controls/interface should I make available to the user?
    - How does each interaction update the state?

## Tic-Tac-Toe Specific Grading Criteria

### As users playing a two player game we want to:

    -Enter our names and have them displayed
    -Have our order chosen for us by the game
    -Take turns placing our marks in empty spaces
    -Not be able to place our marks in an occupied space
    -Be told when a move causes a player to win, or to draw
    -Start the game over without having to reset the browser

### As a user playing a one player game I want to:

    -See the name 'Computer' displayed as my opponent
    -Have the Computer player make moves as if it were a human player with the correct mark in an empty space

### As a user playing a single player game I would be delighted to:

    -Have the Computer make 'better-than-guessing' choices when placing a mark on the board
    -Set the board size myself ("wider" or "taller" than 3x3)
